+ display connected components output (colored regions?)
- make region features part use most central region
    - use connectedComponents return value to be able to loop through components
- add more features
- make sure having multiple training images per object works

- do the instructions mean that we choose between having a video training mode and image training input,
    or that we need both implemented?
- error checking on writing to file?
- how to differentiate training mode and classifying mode?
- ability to read in preexisting feature db file? if preexisting, skip training mode?
- have command-line args for whether still images or video, whether using existing db?
- use displayBBoxContour to combine both output windows into one?

feature options
- the central moments (µ20, µ02 and µ22)
+ the ratio of major axis to minor axis
+ the percentage fill within the oriented bounding box
- eccentricity
- hue
- saturation
- entropy of the matrix containing only the object pixels
- more moments
- the width to height ratio
- eigenvalues of the object
