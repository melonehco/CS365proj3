- display connected components output
- make region features part use most central region
    - use connectedComponents return value to be able to loop through components
- add more features
- use a struct to store features instead of a vector?
- get video input working

feature options
- the central moments (µ20, µ02 and µ22)
- the ratio of major axis to minor axis
- the percentage fill within the oriented bounding box
- eccentricity
- hue
- saturation
- entropy of the matrix containing only the object pixels
- more moments
- the width to height ratio
- eigenvalues of the object
