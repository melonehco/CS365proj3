+ display connected components output (colored regions?)
- make region features part use most central region, OR just ignore the specks
    - use connectedComponents return value to be able to loop through components
- add more features
[DONE] make sure having multiple training images per object works
- probably reorganize into multiple files if we can get it working

- do the instructions mean that we choose between having a video training mode and image training input,
    or that we need both implemented?
    - answer: we choose
- error checking on writing to file?
- how to differentiate training mode and classifying mode?
- ability to read in preexisting feature db file? if preexisting, skip training mode?
- have command-line args for whether still images or video, whether using existing db?
- use displayBBoxContour to combine both output windows into one?
- make separate file for all the feature methods??

feature options
- [WIP] the central moments (µ20, µ02 and µ22)
+ the ratio of major axis to minor axis 
+ the percentage fill within the oriented bounding box
- eccentricity
- hue (what does this mean??)
- saturation
- entropy of the matrix containing only the object pixels
- more moments (convex hull ratio?)
+ the width to height ratio
- eigenvalues of the object
